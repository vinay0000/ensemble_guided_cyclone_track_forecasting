# ensemble_guided_cyclone_track_forecasting

This repository contains the python implementation (Jupyter Notebooks) of the EGCTF algorithm as described in the following paper:
V. Ravindra, S. Nag and A. Li, "Ensemble-Guided Tropical Cyclone Track Forecasting for Optimal Satellite Remote Sensing," in IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, doi: 10.1109/TGRS.2020.3010821.

The paper can also be found in the folder labelled 'docs'.

Following is description of the scripts:

1. egctf_main : *This is the main-module which contains the EGCTF algorithm and its sub-functions. This module is to be executed prior to invoking the EGCTF algorithm. See the `test_one_case` script for an example of how to utilize this module. This file need not be modified unless the user wishes to make some deeper changes in the EGCTF algorithm.*

2. generate_iterative_ensemble_test_data: *This notebook parses the GEFS ensemble data (ATCF format) and the NHC best-track data and stores the parsed data in python `pickle` object format.*

3. test_one_case: *This notebook executes any user-chosen test-case. Algorithm parameters also maybe configured here.*

4. test_obs_freq: *This notebook analyses the behaviour of the EGCTF performance to varying observation frequency and sensor-noise levels.*

5. test_noise_vs_subseglen: *This notebook analyses the behaviour of the EGCTF performance to varying sensor-noise levels and subsegment lengths.*

6. test_using_ens_slope_vs_linear_extrp: *This notebook compares the behaviour of the EGCTF performance with use of the optimal ensemble track based displacement vector versus the displacement vector obtained from the previous estimated TC positions.*

7. test_many_cases: *The notebook tests all the available test-cases and summarizes the results.*


## Quick Start:

Begin by simply executing the `test_one_case` notebook.
